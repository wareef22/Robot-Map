Then I created a database for the robot map with the name (rmap) I added 5 columns (F1,R1,L1,B1,S1).

Then I wrote the php code to connect the interface to the database

The way to use the robot map is very easy

When you press any button you want the robot to go in its direction, the data is sent to the database, and then the robot starts moving in the direction you pressed

and I created a page to make it easier for the user The page has two buttons, one that takes you to the robot arm control page that I created previously, and the other button takes you to the robot map page :
