This repository is about creating a map for the robot :

The first thing to do is create an html page

Then I created the (rmap) database and put 5 columns(F1,R1,L1,B1,S1).

Then I wrote a php code to connect the interface to the database

Of the robot How to use  the Map:
If you press any of the robot buttons in any path you want to go, the data will be sent to the base
Then the robot starts moving


I also made a page to be easy for the user:
It contains two buttons, one that takes you to the arm control page that you created before, and the second takes you to the robot map page
